# LowLevelProject
Project for the Low Level and Embedded System Programming exam.

In this project a simple IoT implementation will be exploited, composed by an Arduino UNO board powered by an ATMega328P microcontroller, connected to an ultrasonic sensor, an LCD display and a servo motor, to simulate a Smart Lock provided with an RFID access control.
